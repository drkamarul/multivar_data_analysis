### What is R Markdown?

In short,

- R Markdown document allows reproducible report for data science.
- You can run R code and generate quality report.

### Why should we bother learning R Markdown?
A few questions:

- Have you recently made some changes to the data? Just generate a new report in seconds!
- Do you need to include some more analyses and plots? Just add in some R code and generate a new report in seconds!
- Do need to share the report but too lazy to edit? Compile and share nicely prepared report!

### Sources to learn R Markdown
R Markdown resources:

- Main website: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/
- Most important, cheatsheet!: https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown.pdf
- Part of _R for Data Science_ book: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown-formats.html
- The definitive guide by the masters: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/
- And a more advanced guide by the masters: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/

Because R Markdown is based on Markdown, it is important to know the syntax:

- A good introduction to Markdown: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
- Basic syntax: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax and extended syntax: https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax

## R Markdown Basics

### Install `rmarkdown` package

```
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

### Install LaTeX package for PDF
R Markdown relies on LaTeX package, which can be installed on the respective OSs,

- Windows & MacOS -- MikTeX @ https://miktex.org/download
- Linux -- texlive.

LaTeX package is important so that you can generate PDF output.

### New .Rmd file
- From menu, select **File > New file > R script**
- Edit the **Title** and **Author** fields.
- Choose any of the **Default Output Format**.
- A basic template will be generated.

### Knit it!
- Click on **Knit** menu. You may click on the dropdown menu for more options.
- Compare the contents in the .Rmd file and your output.

### YAML header
- Anything that are included in between the two `---`.
- Basically we have the `title`, `author`, `date` and `output`.
- This can be further customized.

### Code chunks
- In between the opening three backticks ` ``` ` and closing three backticks ` ``` `. It can be any code here.
- Include the opening as ` ```{r} ` to specify the chunk as R code.

### Header levels
- First level, second level and third level are preceded by `#`, `##` and `###`.
- Add more `#` for more header sublevel.

### Exercise 1
1. Customize the template with your own analyses and plots.
2. Explore chunk options (refer to R Markdown Cheatsheet). More important ones are:

    - `echo`
    - `eval`
    - `comment`

## Table

### Basic table
A sample table like this:

```
| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|---:|:---|---|:---:|
| 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 |
| 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 

Table: Sample table
```

becomes like this:

| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|---:|:---|---|:---:|
| 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 |
| 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |

Table: Sample table

### Table (from data frame)
```{r comment = "", echo = FALSE}
cat("```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(head(iris))
```")
```

becomes:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(iris))
```

### More on table
You can explore the following packages for table:

- `kableExtra`
- `stargazer`

## Plot, figure and image

### Plot caption -- `fig.cap`
```{r comment = "", echo = FALSE}
cat('```{r, fig.cap="Sample caption", echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```')
```

becomes:

```{r, fig.cap="Sample caption", echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

### Plot size -- `fig.height`(in inch)
```{r comment = "", echo = FALSE}
cat('```{r, fig.cap="Sample caption", echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
plot(pressure)
```')
```

becomes:

```{r, fig.cap="Sample caption", echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
plot(pressure)
```

### Plot size -- `fig.width` (in inch)
```{r comment = "", echo = FALSE}
cat('```{r, fig.cap="Sample caption", echo=FALSE, fig.width=3}
plot(pressure)
```')
```

becomes:

```{r, fig.cap="Sample caption", echo=FALSE, fig.width=3}
plot(pressure)
```

### Plot aspect ratio -- `fig.asp`
```{r comment = "", echo = FALSE}
cat('```{r, fig.cap="Sample caption", echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.asp=1}
plot(pressure)
```')
```

becomes:

```{r, fig.cap="Sample caption", echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.asp=1}
plot(pressure)
```

## Image
To add image is as simple as:
```
![caption](image_path}
```

For example,
```
![Sample image](smile.png)
```
becomes:

![Sample image](smile.png)

We may add `width` to change the size of the image,
```
![caption](image_path){width=}
```

For example,
```
![Sample image](smile.png){width=25%}
```
becomes:

![Sample image](smile.png){width=25%}

### Exercise 2
1. Create a report containing tables, figures and images.


## Inline output

R output can be included in an R Markdown document using a code chunk, for example,
```{r}
mean(iris$Petal.Width)
```

The code chunck can be included in between the text, for example
```{r, eval=FALSE}
The mean of petal width is `r mean(iris$Petal.Width)`.
```
becomes:

```
The mean of petal width is `r mean(iris$Petal.Width)`.
```

## Equation

### Mathematical equation
We need the knowledge of mathematical expressions and symbols used in LaTeX to be able to utilize it in R Markdown. This can be learned from these good sources:

1. A good starter: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions
2. More advanced reference: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics
3. A (quite) an extensive list of mathematical symbols: https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols

### Inline equation
Inline equation is included between two `$` signs, for example,
```{r, eval=FALSE}
The equation is $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$
```

The equation is $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$

### Display equation
Display equation is included between two `$$` signs, for example,
```{r, eval=FALSE}
The equation is,

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$
```

The equation is,

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$

### Exercise 3
1. Create a report containing inline outputs and equations.
