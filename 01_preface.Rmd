# Preface {-}

We write this book to help new R users who have limited programming and statistical background. The main audience for this book will be medical epidemiologists, public health researchers and analysts and post-graduate students in public health and epidemiology. 

The book aims to help R users to quickly able to make plots, explore data and to perform regression analysis using the R programming language in RStudio IDE setting.

We used *Rmarkdown* to write this book using the **bookdown** package and because of that we are entirely grateful for people who have developed this platform at RStudio and outside RStudio. 

All in all, we hope you enjoy this book!
