This is the *web* version of our book **Multivariable Data Analysis in Health and Medicine Using R**. We built this book using the bookdown package in RStudio IDE. The book is accesible here https://bookdown.org/drki_musa/multivariable_analysis/

We appreciate all the people at RStudio for developing the bookdown package and hosting the book on bookdown platform. The package and the platform enables writers such as us to optimally use our time and resources. The platform provides easy access to the book for all readers. 

If you like to know moew about bookdown, we recommend you to head to "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ . It contains useful information for writers who want to compile thier book into HTML and other formats. 

You may generate a copy of the book in `bookdown::pdf_book` format by calling `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')`. More detailed instructions are available here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html. You can find the preview of this example at https://bookdown.org/drki_musa/dataanalysis/ 

And lastly, **Thank you Yihui and RStudio**
